# Indic AIDias

Indic AIDias is an independent, 501(c)3 non-profit organization with a mission to make machine learning (ML) research opportunities, including collaboration and mentorship opportunities **accessible** and **free** for all.

Indic AIDias is a community for genuinely curious people who are interested in getting better at doing machine learning research, for whatever reason. 

To that end, the community-building aspect of Indic is creating a place to:
1. Develop and train relevant skills for maturing into a researcher.
2. Find kindred spirits, friends, and collaborators along the way.
3. Produce serious research.
4. Give back to society.

Indic can be a "research home" for you regardless of your affiliation, employer, or background.
